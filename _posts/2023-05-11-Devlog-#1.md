### Lighting Changes

We are working hard to balance having amazing visuals with keeping the game performative.

### Optimization

We have been hard at work once again making the game run better for you all. There is still a lot of work to be done but we hope it's starting to feel better!

If you are curious about the time frame of when the full game will be available for release, we expect to release it sometime in Q3-Q4 of 2023. However, on our everlasting mission to bring you all content, we are going to release the game in early access when we feel like there is enough content to warrant an early access build. We will then release updates to early access until we feel like the game is ready to be fully released.
