## Introduction:

Hello everyone! Thank you for your patience during this time of few updates. We have a small hotfix along with some exciting news to share with you!

## Changelog:

- Fixed a bug with XR runtime on steam builds of the game
- Fixed "shake the flashlight" tooltip not showing correctly sometimes
- Updated the game icon to reflect our newly created game logo and icon

## What's Next

We have been working incredibly hard at creating the full game now. The demo is at a place now that we feel we are okay to work solely on the final game and prepare for the early access release. We will keep you all informed here on our news website but know that the full game is in production!

## Conclusion:

Please report any bugs you find to our Twitter account [@SleepyDogDevs](https://twitter.com/sleepydogdevs). Thank you for playing and we look forward to releasing future content soon!
