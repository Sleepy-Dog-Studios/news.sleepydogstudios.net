## New Developer Streams

Hey guys! Thanks for keeping up with the game! With the excitement of Steam NextFest currently going on, we wanted to announce that we will be doing some developer streams in the future where the community can come watch us talk, play, and work on the game.

Our next stream will be happening on Friday, February 9th, at 7:30pm EST (4:30pm PST).

We plan to continue this trend and do some more developer streams in the coming future so stay tuned!

We hope to see you there at our next one!!

Sincerely,
The Development Team at Sleepy Dog Studios
