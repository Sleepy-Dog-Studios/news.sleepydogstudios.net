## Introduction:

Hello everyone! Thanks for visiting our news website! Today we have a small update to roll out with some changes, bug fixes, and additions to the demo of the game.

Now that the full game's development is officially in development, we are going to be altering the way that we code versions for the demo in the game. Instead of using the more traditional vX.X.X way of counting versions, we are going to be using a new system of counting Builds in a count. So for example, this update is assigned to "Build 8." The next build will be "Build 9, Build 10, Build 11, etc.."

Anyways, enough of that! Let's dive into the patch notes!

## Changelog:

- Revamped the tutorial screen video with new voice acting by Matt from the BMFVR youtube channel! Thank you so much for being apart of this project!
- Updated some models to reflect our chosen timeframe a little bit more
- Added a game over screen for when you die to the shadow in game!
- Improved the enemy character visuals
