## Introduction:

Hey everyone! We hope you guys are doing well! Today we have some exciting news to share with you! Before we show you the changes, we wanted to real quick shoutout the [Oculus Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5698959206825837/) version of the game. Now let's dive into the changes!

## Changelog:

### Lighting Changes

We are working hard to balance having amazing visuals with keeping the game performative. This has shown to be an incredible challenge, especially talking specifically about the Quest 2 version of the game. The lighting isn't perfect, however, we are getting close to what we would like it to look like. There are some screenshots attached so that you can see the improvements.

### Optimization

We have been hard at work once again making the game run better for you all. There is still a lot of work to be done but we hope it's starting to feel better!

### Next Map

We aren't going to say what the next map coming to the game is, but we wanted to let you all know that now that the quest build is done, we are putting our full energy into bringing the next map to life so stay tuned!

## Conclusion:

If you are curious about the time frame of when the full game will be available for release, we expect to release it sometime in Q3-Q4 of 2023. However, on our everlasting mission to bring you all content, we are going to release the game in early access when we feel like there is enough content to warrant an early access build. We will then release updates to early access until we feel like the game is ready to be fully released.

Make sure to wishlist the game so that you can stay posted on new updates! 2023 is going to be there year of The Obsessive Shadow!
